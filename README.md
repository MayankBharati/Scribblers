# Skribbl-Helper: Elevate Your Skribbl.io Gaming Experience üéÆ

Are you a fan of online multiplayer games and seeking a competitive edge in the popular Skribbl.io? If so, our Chrome extension, Skribbl-Helper, is designed to enhance your gaming experience by providing helpful hints to up your Skribbl.io skills.

## The Story Behind Skribbl-Helper
Skribbl.io is a fantastic and fast-paced multiplayer game that's perfect for having a blast with friends. During the COVID lockdown, many of us found solace and entertainment in the game, similar to the popularity of Among Us. As an enthusiastic Skribbl.io player, I noticed that some words were recurring quite frequently.

Like any tech enthusiast, I embarked on a quest to find a database or word list online, just in case someone had meticulously compiled every word used in the game. To my delight, I stumbled upon [skribbliohints.github.io](http://skribbliohints.github.io), a treasure trove of word hints.

This discovery inspired me to create a Chrome extension that could efficiently utilize this word list and enhance the Skribbl.io experience. Special thanks to [betab0t](https://github.com/betab0t/SkribblHints) for the fantastic Chrome extension template that served as the foundation for this project.

However, I recognized that fully automating the process could disrupt the fun of the game and potentially lead to expulsion from Skribbl.io. So, I took a different approach ‚Äì Skribbl-Helper drops hints on your screen in order of relevance, allowing you to enjoy the game as usual while benefiting from valuable word hints.
